<section header { font-family: "Arial Bold": }>
<ul>

<p> Many of us think that digital design has gotten a lot harder, even has taken the fun outta it. Web Design began in 1995. People have ran into problems which were fixed by “Liquid Layout”. It made it possible for other types on computers or networks to have the same software.They had a bunch of ideas for different ways of designs, and then came up with HTML5. Things like pages were added into the system. Then a thing called “stress case” came, this help different kinds of users. Do we need more than HTML5 and css? The answer is maybe, maybe not. It all depends on what you wanna do. Some people have adopted Sass for the benefits. However the design world hasn't changed in a long time and probably will stay like this for a while.
